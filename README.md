## Purpose

This project was developed to strengthen my core skills in front-end development and logical thinking.  
It reflects my ability to plan, design, and build a complete interactive web application from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

I took the lead role in this project—handling everything from UI design to functionality and data persistence—demonstrating initiative, problem-solving, and a self-driven approach to learning.

This project also serves as a hands-on showcase of my readiness for real-world development work and software academy programs like Freshworks.
